<p>This is a model CubeSat used to perform overall testing of the subsystems that we have previously built. The subsystems are:   </p>

<p>(1) Reaction wheel motor. This is often used in a satellite system for attitude control such as pointing to a certain direction i.e. earth (which is useful for taking image of earth).   </p>

<p>(2) Inertial Measurement Unit + Kalman Filter. IMU consists of accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. This is used to obtain orientation of a satellite body. However, the data from these sensors are very noisy, hence we implement Kalman Filter to minimize the error.    </p>

<p>(3) Sun sensor. This is used to obtain the location of sun with respect to the satellite body. The attitude of the satellite can then be estimated with the sun sensor.     </p>

<p>The device is powered by an ARM Cortex-M4F STM32 NUCLEO based driver board. Data is transmitted wirelessly to the main computer (to simulate ground station) and plotted in real time.</p>
